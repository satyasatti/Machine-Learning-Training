    "With it origin as an open source scripting language, Python usage has grown over time. Today, it has libraries (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, etc.) and functions for almost any statistical operation / model building you may want to do.

    "\n",
    "#### Python 3\n",
    "Python 3 is regarded as the future of Python and is the version of the language that is currently in development. A major overhaul, Python 3 was released in late 2008 to address and amend intrinsic design flaws of previous versions of the language. The focus of Python 3 development was to clean up the codebase and remove redundancy, making it clear that there was only one way to perform a given task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Major modifications to Python 3.0 included changing the print statement into a built-in function, improve the way integers are divided, and providing more Unicode support.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first, Python 3 was slowly adopted due to the language not being backwards compatible with Python 2, requiring people to make a decision as to which version of the language to use. Additionally, many package libraries were only available for Python 2, but as the development team behind Python 3 has reiterated that there is an end of life for Python 2 support, more libraries have been ported to Python 3. The increased adoption of Python 3 can be shown by the number of Python packages that now provide Python 3 support, which at the time of writing includes 339 of the 360 most popular Python packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python 2.7\n",
    "Following the 2008 release of Python 3.0, Python 2.7 was published on July 3, 2010 and planned as the last of the 2.x releases. The intention behind Python 2.7 was to make it easier for Python 2.x users to port features over to Python 3 by providing some measure of compatibility between the two. This compatibility support included enhanced modules for version 2.7 like unittest to support test automation, argparse for parsing command-line options, and more convenient classes in collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of Python 2.7’s unique position as a version in between the earlier iterations of Python 2 and Python 3.0, it has persisted as a very popular choice for programmers due to its compatibility with many robust libraries. When we talk about Python 2 today, we are typically referring to the Python 2.7 release as that is the most frequently used version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 2.7, however, is considered to be a legacy language and its continued development, which today mostly consists of bug fixes, will cease completely in 2020."

    "Virtualenv is a package that allows you to create named “virtual environments”, where you can install pip packages in an isolated manner.\n",

    "Now, if you are primarily doing data science work, Anaconda is also a great option. It is a Python distribution that comes preinstalled with lots of useful python libraries for data science.\n",

    "Anaconda is popular because it brings many of the tools used in data science and machine learning with just one install, so it’s great for having short and simple setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like Virtualenv, Anaconda also uses the concept of creating environments so as to isolate different libraries and versions. Anaconda also introduces its own package manager, called conda, from where you can install libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, Anaconda still has the useful interaction with pip that allows you to install any additional libraries which are not available in the Anaconda package manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "### pyenv\n",
    "We can opt to use both, and manage the whole thing using a library called *pyenv*. Conceptually, pyenv sits atop both virtualenv and anaconda, and it can be used to control not only which virtualenv environment or anaconda environment is in use, but it also easily controls whether you are running Python 2 or Python 3.\n",
